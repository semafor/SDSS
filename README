Set up fuseki:
    Either run on localhost:3030 and use the data set /info216, 
    or change the references in Main.java.
    
    I run fuseki like this:
        ./fuseki-server --loc=/tmp/fuseki -update /info216

    After you've started fuseki, you can upload src/data/example.n3 into
    the /info216 dataset to the graph <http://apollo.nasa.gov/KnowledgeBase>.
    
    The example data show a sample of the model of the
    Apollo 13 situation at ~57 GET.
